## Problem Statement 
The Farmer School of Business (FSB) faces challenges in accurately tracking retention and graduation trends for Business Analytics (BA) and Information Systems (IS) majors. Existing classifications based on credit hours and unclear criteria revealed discrepancies that hinder meaningful retention analysis. This study aims to address these challenges by applying consistent course completion thresholds to analyze student progression and identify retention trends.

## Research Questions
1. What are the trends in retention and graduation rates for BA and IS majors across different academic years?
2. What factors contribute to discrepancies in student progression, including drops in enrollment and graduation rates?
3. How can we design a reproducible system to effectively track and analyze student retention and graduation data?

## List of Deliverables 
1. Data Documents & Cleaning Files
2. Final Power BI Files
3. Technical Report
4. Reproducibility Document
