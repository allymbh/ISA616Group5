## Problem Statement 
The Farmer School of Business (FSB) faces challenges in accurately tracking retention and graduation trends for Business Analytics (BA) and Information Systems (IS) majors. Existing classifications based on credit hours and unclear criteria revealed discrepancies that hinder meaningful retention analysis. This study aims to address these challenges by applying consistent course completion thresholds to analyze student progression and identify retention trends.
